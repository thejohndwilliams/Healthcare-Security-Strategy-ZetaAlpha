# Healthcare Security Strategy — Zeta Alpha Medical

**A Unified Approach to Cybersecurity and Information Integrity in Healthcare Technology**

---

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive cybersecurity policy handbook developed for **Zeta Alpha Medical**, a fictitious medical diagnostic and treatment system (MDTS) technology company operating across the United States, Canada, and Singapore. The handbook demonstrates end-to-end security policy development for a healthcare technology organization navigating HIPAA, GDPR, and FDA regulatory environments.

The primary deliverable is:

📄 **[ZetaAlpha_PolicyHandbook_Revised.docx](./ZetaAlpha_PolicyHandbook_Revised.docx)** — Complete security policy handbook (Word format)
